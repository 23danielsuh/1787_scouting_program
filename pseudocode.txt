final output:
    team number, points scored, points scored in auto, charge station points, number of cycles, defense, links


on each team page:
    average everything
    bar graph with 3 bins of low mid and high for every match
    pie chart for unbalanced, balanced, and none for auto
    pie chart for unbalanced, balanced, and none for teleop
    pie chart for defense
    something about links
    copy from previous thing


maybe do:
    grab data from tba to see how much percentage they carried the team

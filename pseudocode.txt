read dataframe and process data to good format
map every team number to the corresponding data


dataframe:

    auto:
        low, mid, upper
    teleop:
        low, mid, upper
    total points
    cycles
    balancing information
    defense
    additional notes


final output:
    team number, points scored, points scored in auto, charge station points, number of cycles, defense, links


on each team page:
    average everything
    bar graph with 3 bins of low mid and high for every match
    pie chart for unbalanced, balanced, and none for auto
    pie chart for unbalanced, balanced, and none for teleop
    pie chart for defense
    something about links
